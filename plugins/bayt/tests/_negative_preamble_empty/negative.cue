// A preamble entry must pick an arm. One that names none is INCOMPLETE
// rather than a conflict, so `cue eval` tolerates it and only `cue export`
// rejects — and export is what generate's pass-2 runs. Covered with
// export-fail for the same reason as _negative_add.
//
// Without this the arms could stop being mutually exhaustive and the only
// symptom would be a generate-time error nobody had ever seen.
