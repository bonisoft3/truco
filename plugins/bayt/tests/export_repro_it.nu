# export_repro_it.nu — what actually makes a pushed leaf's digest reproducible.
#
# A leaf is exported once per commit and its manifest is the identity consumers
# and any content-addressed skip both key on. Two exporter settings claim to
# protect that identity, and they are not equals:
#
#   rewrite-timestamp  normalises layer mtimes at export
#   attestations       add provenance/SBOM manifests to the index
#
# The bayt pipeline already clamps mtimes INSIDE the build (`_ctxs` stage),
# and `COPY --from` carries the clamped mtimes through the `_srcs` flatten into
# the leaf — so the export has nothing left to normalise. This asserts that
# directly, over the 2x2 of both settings, with host mtimes floated between the
# two builds of each cell the way a fresh checkout floats them.
#
# Asserts, per cell: digest stable iff attestations are off — rewrite-timestamp
# does not appear in the condition. Attestations carry a build timestamp, so
# they drift the index on their own and no exporter attr can hold it still.
#
# Randomised names, so concurrent runs don't collide.
