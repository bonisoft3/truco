# scoped_clamp_it.nu — guards the scoped mtime clamp in
# gen_compose.cue `_clampFlatten`: a nested-dir synthetic's flattened
# `FROM scratch` stage must have a REPRODUCIBLE digest (the identity that
# service-graph dedup and the registry cache key rely on).
#
# Only nested-dir projects exercise the scoping — the other integration tests
# build root projects (workdir == /monorepo), where `find /monorepo/<dir>`
# degenerates to the whole tree. Here a consumer at /monorepo/a/b pulls two deps
# under a shared parent /monorepo/x. Neither dep subtree nor /monorepo/x is in
# the consumer's clamp scope ({/monorepo, /monorepo/a} + the a/b walk); they must
# stay at EPOCH on their own via `COPY --from`, which preserves the dep stages'
# already-clamped mtimes even when the second copy merges into /monorepo/x.
# Asserts: (1) clamp on → digest identical across two builds with floated host
# mtimes; (2) clamp off (BAYT_CLAMP=0) → digests differ, proving the clamp (not
# SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH alone, set in both runs) is what makes it reproducible —
# i.e. the test isn't vacuous, and the toggle actually disables the clamp.
#
# Randomised names, so concurrent runs don't collide.
