# diamond_dedup_it.nu — end-to-end "expensive bottom runs once" guard.
#
# Models a true DIAMOND against a real buildkit:
#
#         top              consumes both arms, compares the two markers
#        /    \
#       A      B           each COPY --from the shared bottom
#        \    /
#        bottom            the "expensive" node — emits a NON-deterministic marker
#
# Each node is a SEPARATE per-target Dockerfile federated via `contexts =
# {bottom = "target:bottom"}` — the exact cross-target shape bayt's generator
# emits (and the same federation the cache-hit test models for the fan-in case).
# A single multi-stage Dockerfile would dedup trivially; the interesting bayt
# regression hides in the per-target federation.
#
# HOW "RUNS ONCE" IS PROVEN (soundly):
#   bottom's RUN writes a RANDOM marker (/dev/urandom). Both arms COPY it; `top`
#   diffs the two copies.
#     - bottom executed ONCE  → both arms see the same random marker → diff passes
#                               → bake exits 0.
#     - bottom executed TWICE → two different random markers → diff fails
#                               → bake exits non-zero.
#   So `bake exit 0` <=> the expensive bottom ran exactly once. The marker being
#   non-deterministic is what makes this airtight: two separate executions cannot
#   coincidentally agree.
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS (the bayt-relevant part):
#   buildkit dedups a shared `target:` subgraph by CACHE KEY. The realistic way
#   bayt could break "runs once" is injecting an arm-specific input (a
#   per-consumer build-arg, label, or context) into the otherwise-shared bottom
#   stage — that splits the cache key and forces a second execution of the
#   expensive node. This test fails loudly if that regresses.
#
# SECONDARY STRUCTURAL ASSERTION:
#   parses --progress=rawjson and asserts the bottom RUN resolves to exactly ONE
#   distinct vertex digest — a direct dedup count with a clearer diagnostic than
#   a bare build failure.
#
# LIMITATION: like the cache-hit test, this hand-writes the bake.hcl modeling the
# shape bayt emits, not bayt's generator output. It guards "the federated-target:
# diamond dedups", not "bayt's generated diamond project dedups". Driving the
# generator is a larger follow-up.
#
# Names are randomized per invocation so concurrent runs don't collide.
