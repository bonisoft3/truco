// Mirror-only module declaration. Copybara stages this file from
// plugins/pronto/.mirror/cue.mod/ to the bonisoft3/pronto root as
// cue.mod/module.cue. The monorepo itself has no cue.mod here —
// in-monorepo CUE imports resolve against the root cue.mod
// (bonisoft.org). Copybara rewrites import paths from
// bonisoft.org/plugins/pronto → github.com/bonisoft3/pronto during
// sync, and the sibling modules pronto's adapters import along with
// them, so the mirror is a self-contained CUE module.

// The adapters import one sibling each — terminals/omnishell.cue, clusters/
// mecha.cue, loops/sayt.cue — and emit.cue imports bayt's build vocabulary.
// The mirror resolves all four from the Central Registry. `cue mod publish`
// refuses an untidy module, and `cue mod tidy` writes this block by fetching
// the registry — a write the publish would then refuse as an unclean tree.
// Stating it here keeps the mirror publishable from a pure copy, and the
// `cue mod tidy --check` the mirror's cd.yml runs before publishing is what
// fails when one of these versions falls behind.
