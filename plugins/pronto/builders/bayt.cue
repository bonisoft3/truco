// Pronto's builder roster, by indirection: each file here re-exports one
// build-graph implementation from its product home. Pronto owns the list;
// the implementations own themselves (bayt's lives in bonisoft3/bayt).
// Consumers import bonisoft.org/plugins/pronto/builders:<name>.
//
// The build graph reaches bayt the way .say.yaml reaches sayt: the
// program's `build:` seat is authored here as #Build, `cue export` lands
// the resolved value as concrete bayt.json, and the app's bayt.cue is a
// thin stub that embeds that file and unifies it back through
// bayt.#project — bayt's schema stays live at generate time, and stack
// staleness is bounded by one build cycle (the writer re-exports on every
// loop turn). Ownership: bayt.json is the do-not-edit artifact; the stub
// is the human seam — escape-hatch overrides unify there, after the embed.
