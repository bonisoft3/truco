// plugins/pronto/bayt.cue — source-only bayt project for the pronto compiler.
//
// pronto ships no runtime image. It is a set of deno programs an app's verbs
// invoke from the app's own directory, so what this project exists to give is
// `plugins_pronto:setup:srcs` — the way a cross-project consumer pulls the
// compiler into a build context — and a build stage whose RUN is a typecheck
// of the programs themselves, against the context that consumer receives.
// Mirrors how omnishell exposes `plugins_omnishell:build:srcs`.
