// The store is one surface with two things behind it, and they have to stay the
// same shape.
//
// data-sync is the store. batched-store is the adapter that decomposes the same
// calls for the test doubles, so a smoke exercises the interpreter's real write
// path against a double that only knows one row at a time. Nothing else makes
// them agree, and a method renamed on one side is invisible until an app breaks:
// the store this pair replaced drifted exactly that way — a `write` still taking
// rows after the surface moved to {key, row} edits, an `upsertBy` resolving
// another key — and no suite noticed, because nothing ran it.
//
// This pins the names only. What each one MEANS is every other test in this
// directory; what this catches is a method renamed, added, or dropped on one
// side of the pair.
