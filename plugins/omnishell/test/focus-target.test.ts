// `data-focus`: move focus to the member a column names, and leave the tab
// order alone.
//
// The split from `data-rove` is APG's own. Some patterns get one tab stop and
// arrows that move it; an accordion's headers are ALL in the Tab sequence and
// the arrows are an addition. Stamping a tabstop there would take headers out
// of the sequence — a worse contract than the one it replaced — so the two
// effects the terminal fused have to come apart.
//
// Nothing is remembered here: the DOM holds where focus is, so the rule reads
// it. What keeps the terminal and the reader from fighting over it is
// `focusin`, and focusLint refuses a region that does not hear it.
