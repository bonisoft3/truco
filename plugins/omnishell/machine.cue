// The machine vocabulary, published beside the capability roster (same
// package; its own file so `cue vet -d '#Machine'` can load it without the
// shell-asset embeds terminal.cue carries).
//
// #Machine is the XState-JSON data subset the terminal executes itself — no
// compartment, because a machine is data. Value positions — a guard, an
// assign's value, an `after` delay — hold a literal or the name of a Jessie
// module (resolved like any data-on-* handler, called with the reduce's
// signature); everything that draws the chart — targets, initial, context,
// state names, raised event types — is always data. The machine is closed
// over its row: its leaves see {items: [row]} and nothing else, its writes
// never leave the row, and every transition lands as one stated row through
// the same step() machinery reduces use — replay, tempo and the refusal
// event apply with the machine knowing nothing.
//
// A machine writes the row a browser owns; a form writes the row a server
// keeps. That is the whole choice between them — an assign states screen state
// as it changes, a submit commits data on a gesture — and it is why every
// table a machine writes is a tab or device one.
//
// The machine is the writer of the initial fact: a region without
// data-empty-row binds a row synthesized from {...context, field: initial}
// plus its filter equalities; where data-empty-row is present it must agree
// (vetted at generate, never arbitrated at runtime).
//
// Everything XState has beyond this shape — invoke, sendTo/emit — fails
// unification loudly. `after` is the relocated invoke: armed on state entry,
// canceled on exit, performed by the terminal's clock. `raise` is the reduce's
// `then:` under XState's name — literal types, so the cascade stays drawable,
// delivered depth-bounded (the deliberate SCXML deviation: a cascade with no
// owner has no end). Root-level `on:` applies in every state unless the state
// declares the same key. Event keys are the terminal's own event types plus the
// synthesized `refused` and `sync_ack`, so `*` is an event no browser sends and
// never a wildcard;
// `<type>@<dom-id>` narrows a transition to one affordance, a spelling
// components generate and no author writes.
//
// A DISPLACING type — `contextmenu`, and it is the whole set — has its default
// canceled wherever an arrow answers it, because the app's answer and the UA's
// cannot both stand. The cancel is the arrow's rather than a second attribute's:
// answering the type is the markup declaring the gesture, which is what every
// cancel the terminal makes already belongs to.
