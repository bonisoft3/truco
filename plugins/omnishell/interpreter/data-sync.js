// Reads: regions with a translatable filter read the synced collections and

// locally so a deleted row evicts the instant its optimistic removal lands
// (a server re-fetch would race the DELETE itself, and in the dev cluster
// every /crud request can queue tens of seconds behind the shape long-polls
// hogging the browser's per-host connection pool). Server-computed reads —
// fts, embed-path filters, hinted/nested embeds — stay ordinary PostgREST
// queries, re-run when any table in their dependency set changes and when
// one of this session's own mutations settles (the collections are the
// change signal, never a clock). Nothing in this file or above it polls.
