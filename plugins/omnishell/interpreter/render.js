// The platform half of the renderer role, and the terminal's DOM mutation
// story. A renderer is a pure (value) => nodes function — no DOM handle, no
// lifecycle, no mount or unmount, no refs, nothing to clean up — so there is
// no state for it to get wrong. Everything that decides what may reach the DOM
// lives here instead: the node schema, the tag and attribute allowlist, the
// URL-scheme check, and the builder.
//
// A node is either a string, which is always a text node, or
// {tag, attrs?, children?}. There is deliberately no node kind for raw markup.
// The schema cannot express it, so no renderer can ask for it, and the builder
// reaches for createElement and textContent and nothing else.
//
// Two kinds of refusal, on a deliberate line. A structural violation — an
// unknown tag, a malformed node, an attribute outside the allowlist — is a bug
// in the renderer, so it throws and the author fixes it. A URL that fails the
// scheme check is user data flowing through a legitimate attribute, so the
// attribute is dropped and the rest of the document still renders: a reader's
// own content must never be able to take the screen down.

// Anything else — javascript:, data:, vbscript: — is not a URL the terminal
// will emit, because those are the schemes a browser executes rather than
// fetches. What passes is what a browser merely fetches or hands to a mail
// client, plus schemeless forms: "/path" and "#frag" resolve against the app's
// own origin, and "//host/path" keeps the scheme and changes the host, which
// reaches a third party exactly as an authored https:// URL already does.
// Refusing the protocol-relative spelling would deny nothing an author cannot
// spell another way. Third-party fetches from reader-authored prose are a real
// tracking surface, but the mechanism for that is an origin policy over every
// URL this emits, not a rule about one URL syntax.
