// The terminal's hatch: a vendored unit mounted into a screen behind one of
// two boundaries, fed props and answering with named events.
//
// The unit itself is the app's own, declared in CUE and audited — that is where
// its trust comes from. What sits behind it usually is not: an article embed is
// a provider's page arriving over the network at read time, unreviewable by
// anyone; an engine is megabytes of machine code nobody reads. Which of the two
// a unit is decides its boundary, and the boundaries are not ordered — a frame
// is contained and shares this thread, a worker owns a thread and shares this
// origin.
//
// Props in are a current-value feed, resynchronised on every bind pass, the
// same shape hydrateWidget's update(rows) has. Events out are named and
// request-shaped: the unit describes, the terminal performs. `height` is the
// one name the terminal performs itself; everything else is handed to onEvent,
// its detail parsed here first.

// Fixed, and the terminal's to choose — a unit cannot widen it. Each token
// costs something, so each is here for a stated reason:
//   allow-scripts   the unit is script-driven; without it nothing runs, it
//                   cannot measure itself, and there is no bridge at all.
//   allow-popups    an embed's whole affordance is clicking through to the
//                   source; without it a target=_blank link is swallowed
//                   silently, which reads to the user as a broken embed.
//   allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox
//                   a popup inherits the opener's sandbox unless this is set,
//                   so the provider's own page would open scriptless and
//                   opaque. What it opens is a separate top-level document at
//                   the provider's origin — no more authority than a link in
//                   the article already has.
//
// allow-same-origin is refused, permanently and without a widening path. With
// it the frame shares this origin: it reads our storage and our cookies, and
// for a same-origin src it reaches through window.parent into the screen's own
// DOM. A sandbox carrying it is theatre. The top-navigation tokens are refused
// on the same footing — an embed that can replace the page the reader is on
// has taken the app away from them.
