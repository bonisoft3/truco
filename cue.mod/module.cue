// Mirror-only module declaration. Copybara stages this file from
// .mirror/cue.mod/ to the bonisoft3/truco root as
// cue.mod/module.cue. In the monorepo truco's CUE resolves against the
// root cue.mod (bonisoft.org), which is HEAD; copybara rewrites its imports
// to github.com/bonisoft3/*, and the mirror resolves them from the Central
// Registry at the versions below, the ones .mise.toml installs.
