// The virtual cluster, published as CUE: mecha's canonical local topology as
// bayt targets, instantiated per app. Every service is an addressable field —
// consumers override by unification and drop by setting null; that is the
// escape hatch, and pinning or forking this package is the versioning story.
// Escape-hatch-free apps never see this file: the generator that writes an
// app instantiates it; apps with hatches import it from their bayt.cue.
//
// Each target is bayt's vocabulary: the image is the Dockerfile bayt emits
// from `dockerfile`, the runtime is its `compose` block. A service that
// carries mecha's own content (the database's extensions and tenancy floor,
// the migration runner, the mesh's components, the conduit connector, the
// deno services) starts FROM the image mecha builds for it (bayt.cue, the
// `*-image` targets) and adds only what is the app's: migrations, the
// Caddyfile, pipelines. Names are bare and so are `depends_on` keys; #Runtime
// lowers the targets into a bayt project, which is what keeps `crud:3000` and
// `@database:5432` resolving.
