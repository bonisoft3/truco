  // A remote batch is one offline transaction over the whole set: one commit,

  // commit and hopes.
  //
  // Pacing it here is easy and wrong: splitting the set buys a bounded commit
  // by giving up the all-or-nothing that is the reason to have one. Both at
  // once takes a single request the server applies in a single transaction, so
  // what reopens this is a bulk endpoint on the proxy, not a library.
  //
  // Two costs measured at ten thousand rows in a tab collection, both live on
  // @tanstack/db 0.8.7. A batch deleting in key order splices a shared sorted
  // key array once per row — half the array each time, quadratic in the table,
  // 40 ms of a clear. And a local tier's write mints a UUID and builds a
  // transaction per row for a collection with nothing to be optimistic
  // against: 33 ms of the same clear. The library has the fast path for each —
  // truncate() drops the sorted keys in one assignment, and the sync writer's
  // begin/write/commit skips the optimistic machinery entirely — but both sit
  // inside a SyncConfig.sync belonging to whoever wrote the collection
  // options, and for these rows that is the library: electric's exposes
  // awaitTxId and awaitMatch, local-only's exposes acceptMutations. Either one
  // publishing a truncate or a bulk write reopens this; so would taking over
  // their sync the way union.ts takes over its own.
