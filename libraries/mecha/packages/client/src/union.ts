/**
 * One collection over several sources of the same table, each source a shape.
 *
 * A subject's reach over a table is a set of shapes: its scopes, and one per
 * row it was granted (a note shared to it) -- a set that changes while the
 * screen is open. Electric's collection is one shape, so this is the seam: it
 * mirrors every source into itself and lets the set change underneath.
 *
 * A row is present while any source delivers it. Sources over one table can
 * overlap -- the owner's scope and a grant name the same note -- so a delete
 * from one source removes the row only when no other still holds it, and a
 * source dropped whole takes its unshared rows with it.
