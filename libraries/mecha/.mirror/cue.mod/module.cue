// cue.mod/module.cue. The monorepo itself has no cue.mod here —
// in-monorepo CUE imports resolve against the root cue.mod
// (bonisoft.org). Copybara rewrites import paths from
// bonisoft.org/libraries/mecha → github.com/bonisoft3/mecha during
// sync so the mirror is a self-contained CUE module.

// bayt.cue and the .bayt/ it generates import the build vocabulary, which
// the mirror resolves from the Central Registry. `cue mod publish` refuses an
// untidy module, and `cue mod tidy` writes this block by fetching the latest
// version — a write the publish would then refuse as an unclean tree. Stating
// it here keeps the mirror publishable from a pure copy, and the `cue mod
// tidy --check` the mirror's cd.yml runs before publishing is what fails when
// this version falls behind.
