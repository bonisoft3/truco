// The service images mecha builds, by service. Its release builds and pushes
// each (cd.yml's matrix lists the same) and prints each one's pin. A consumer
// pins what it builds on: pronto holds the pins (clusters/mecha.cue), checked
// against #Published.

// A pin is an image a release pushed to Docker Hub, by version and digest. The
// compose service and fragment an app builds from in the monorepo follow from
// the key (libraries_mecha-<service>-image).
