# The auth service's token contract

Three components read these tokens and only one mints them, so the shape is
stated here rather than in each: this service issues, PostgREST verifies, and
the emitter writes the policies that call `auth_uid()`.

- **HS256**, claims `{role, sub, handle, exp}`, secret from `PGRST_JWT_SECRET`.
  A dev default ships so a fresh cluster boots; production overrides it.
- **A user token** carries role `app_user` and `sub` = the `app_user` row id.
- **A service token** carries role `service` and the nil uuid, pre-signed
  against the dev secret and delivered as a compose env default. It exists so a
  transform can write without a reader, which is the only caller that has no
  session to borrow.
- **`auth_uid()`** reads `sub` out of `request.jwt.claims`. It is a replaceable
  object, restated by the database image with the tenancy floor and never
  migrated with the tables, so a correction reaches every database without a
  migration.

The alternative was server-side sessions. It was refused because the WebAuthn
challenge is the only state a ceremony needs, and a short-lived `state` JWT
carries it without giving the service anything to lose on restart.
