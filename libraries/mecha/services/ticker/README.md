# ticker

A periodic wake that survives scale-to-zero. One row, a derived key and a dumb
poke.

Four words carry the whole design, and nothing else is a concept:

| | |
|---|---|
| **clock** | The per-tier cadence source. Owns resolution and nothing else. |
| **poke** | A contentless authenticated HTTP request whose only job is to make a scaled-to-zero unit exist. Two of them: the clock pokes the ticker, the ticker pokes the mesh. |
| **tick** | One occurrence of a schedule, as a row in the app's own table, keyed `uuid5(schedule, instant)`. |
| **outcome** | Where a pipeline says it answered a tick. Keyed by the same tick, in a different table, because a source cannot be its own sink. |

`sweep` is the function that runs when poked. It is not a concept.

## The shape

Due-ness is a pure function of `(schedule, now, done)`, and everything a
caller is allowed to be careless about follows from that — **Why a tick needs
no durability** below argues why. What it means here: a poke may be lost,
duplicated, coarse or doubled by a second clock, and none of those changes the
answer.

- `due.ts` — the pure core: what a schedule owes at an instant. No clock of its
  own, no network. Its header lists the hard cases it decides.
- `main.ts` — the shell. Reads schedules from crud, writes the rows, advances
  the watermark, wakes the unit that reads the WAL.

```sh
task test          # from libraries/mecha; runs these alongside cue vet + buf lint
deno test --allow-read --allow-env .
```

## Contract

`POST /poke` carries no cadence, no schedule name and no payload. What is due is
never the caller's business. Authorised by the cluster's `SERVICE_JWT`, the same
credential every other write carries. `?caller=<label>` is diagnostic: it is
recorded on every tick, so when two clocks are running you can see which is
winning rather than infer it.

The answer is a report. It is `500` when any schedule errored or the wake did
not land — safe, because a retried sweep rewrites the same keys.

```
POST /poke?caller=cloud-scheduler
Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_JWT

200 {"at":"…","caller":"cloud-scheduler",
     "schedules":[{"schedule":"sweep","emitted":1,"late":0,"held":0,"behind":false}],
     "poke":{"ok":true}}
```

Environment, all required — an unset one refuses to start rather than degrading
into a service that looks healthy and does half its job:

| | |
|---|---|
| `CRUD_URL` | PostgREST directly, not the proxy: the proxy's client-facing `Prefer` injection would clobber the resolution below. |
| `SERVICE_JWT` | Both the incoming poke's credential and the outgoing writes'. |
| `MESH_URL` | daprd's base URL. See **The wake**. |

## One table of mecha's, and the app's own

`schedule` is mecha's mechanism, created by the database image as
`020_schedule.sql` where the cluster declares a schedule, and seeded from the
app's declarations. An app never authors its rows by hand.

```sql
create table schedule (
  name                 text primary key,
  cron                 text not null,             -- five fields, the only grammar
  time_zone            text not null default 'UTC',
  suspended            boolean not null default false,
  max_lateness_seconds integer not null default 300,
  concurrency_policy   text not null default 'Allow'
                         check (concurrency_policy in ('Allow', 'Forbid')),
  done_entity          text,                      -- Forbid requires both
  done_filter          text,                      -- a PostgREST filter
  emits_entity         text not null,
  emits_values         jsonb not null default '{}',
  last_tick_at         timestamptz,               -- the watermark
  check (concurrency_policy <> 'Forbid'
         or (done_entity is not null and done_filter is not null))
);
```

`suspended` is `not null` because the sweep selects on `suspended=is.false`; a
null would silently drop the schedule.

**A tick is the app's row**, and there is no ledger beside it. The table named
by `emits_entity` carries whatever the schedule sets plus five columns mecha
writes last, so a schedule's values can overwrite none of them:

```sql
id        uuid primary key,      -- uuid5(schedule, tick_at); see below
schedule  text not null,
tick_at   timestamptz not null,
late      boolean not null,      -- asked for nothing; a pipeline skips it
caller    text
```

A separate table holds the **outcome**, keyed by the same `id` — separate
necessarily, for the reason in **A fan-out schedule** below. `done_entity` +
`done_filter` are how `Forbid` asks it whether the previous tick was answered.

Retention is not mecha's business. A tick table that should be trimmed gets an
ordinary predicate-driven pipeline to trim it — level-triggered, idempotent,
and the app's own policy.

**Do not add `unique (schedule, tick_at)` to the tick table.** It looks like
belt and braces and it breaks idempotency: `resolution=ignore-duplicates`
resolves against the primary key, so a duplicate `id` comes back as `[]` with
201, while a *secondary* unique violation comes back `23505` with 409. The
derived id already is that uniqueness.

## What the mechanism guarantees

**The key is derived.** `uuid5(mecha-namespace, "<schedule>\n<tick_at>")`, and it
is the primary key of the tick row and of the outcome that answers it, so the
two join on it. A redelivery, a second clock and a retried sweep all write the
same row — see `tickId` for the normalisation that keeps two spellings of one
instant hashing alike.

**The write order is load-bearing.** Emit, record, wake, *then* advance the
watermark — see `sweep` in `main.ts` for why each boundary is where it is. Die
anywhere before the last step and the next poke recomputes the same ticks,
rewrites the same keys, gets empty bodies back and knocks again. Die after and
nothing is owed. It converges from either side, at the cost of a set of absorbed
duplicates instead of a transaction this layer cannot hold.

**`tick_at` is the instant the tick was scheduled for**, never the instant a poke
arrived. That is what makes redelivery recognisable, clock skew harmless, and a
coarse clock produce exact instants.

**Three bounds, all deliberate.** `TICKS_PER_SWEEP = 64` in `main.ts` is the most
one poke emits for a schedule; the watermark moves by what was resolved, so a backlog
drains across pokes instead of running past the caller's deadline and repeating
forever. `WALK_CAP = 512` in `due.ts` guards a pathological expression.
`CALL_TIMEOUT_MS = 10_000` means a hung upstream fails the poke rather than
holding the pass open until something else kills it mid-write.

## Time, decided once

Each of these is pinned by a test in `due_test.ts`, because implementations
differ on exactly these cases.

- **The hour that does not exist** (spring forward). Never due. The guard asks
  whether an instant's local wall time is one the expression *names*, so it
  holds for `30 2,4 * * *` as well as `30 2 * * *`, and correctly admits 03:30
  under `30 * * * *` — that expression names 03:30 in its own right.
- **The hour that happens twice** (fall back). Fires once, at the first instant.
- **Ticks missed while nothing listened.** Older than `max_lateness_seconds` is
  written `late` and not run: a keep-alive forty minutes late is not a
  keep-alive. A pipeline reading the tick table skips those rows, and `Forbid`
  never waits on one — nothing answered it because nothing was asked. One entry
  per poke, so a long outage on a sparse schedule drains across pokes.
- **A run that outlives its cadence.** `Forbid` asks the `done_filter` whether
  the previous tick's row reached a terminal state and declines to emit while it
  has not, without advancing the watermark — so it delays rather than drops.
- **Delivery is at-least-once by design.** The derived key absorbs all of it.

## A fan-out schedule, end to end

The shape every keep-alive-like consumer wants: one tick, N rows, one row per
tenant. The worked example is a session keep-alive for a portal that expires a
session after 15 idle minutes, warns at 14, and renews it on a bare GET carrying
the session's cookies from outside any browser. The numbers are that portal's,
not defaults to copy blindly.

```sql
-- the schedule row this example seeds
name                 = 'session-keepalive'
cron                 = '*/5 * * * *'    -- three touches inside the 15m window
max_lateness_seconds = 300              -- never wider than the cadence
concurrency_policy   = 'Allow'
emits_entity         = 'session_touch'
emits_values         = '{"status": "requested"}'
```

**Cadence 5 minutes against a 15-minute expiry.** Three touches inside the
window, so two can be lost before a session is. A cadence equal to the expiry
has no margin at all, and one at half leaves none for the fan-out's own jitter.

**`max_lateness_seconds` no wider than the cadence.** A touch that arrives after
the next one was already due has defended nothing. At 300 a late tick is
recorded and skipped, which is the honest outcome: the session it was
protecting either survived on a later touch or is already gone, and running it
manufactures a success that hides the loss. **A late tick must be skipped by
the pipeline, not acted on** — it is a row like any other in the emits table,
wearing `late`, and the mapping opens by dropping those.

**`Allow`, deliberately, and this is the one that bites.** A missed touch is
harmless; a wedged schedule is not. `Forbid` holds the watermark until the
previous tick is answered, so one slow or broken tenant stops every subsequent
touch for every tenant — the failure mode is total where the risk was partial.
Reach for `Forbid` only where a second run would do damage.

**Jitter belongs beside the fan-out, never on the schedule.** Calendar cron
fires every tenant on the same instant, so the pipeline offsets each row by a
value derived from the tenant's own id — deterministic, therefore stateless and
reproducible. Keep it under 2 minutes: it is bounded by the lateness budget, and
a tenant whose offset exceeds it is dropped every single time, silently, and
always the same tenants.

### What the emits table carries

It is in the change feed's publication, so conduit reads its rows, and it
carries mecha's five columns. Beyond them a fan-out tick needs nothing — the
tick names an instant, not a tenant. **Which tenants are live is a question for
the pipeline**, asked when it runs, against rows that may have changed since the
tick was minted. Putting a tenant list on the tick would freeze it at mint time
and reintroduce the fan-out this design moved out.

### What the outcome row looks like when the touch is a GET

The signal is thin on purpose: a touch succeeds when it is **not** redirected to
the login door. So the outcome is not "200 OK" — a login page is also 200. It is
the absence of a redirect, or the presence of a marker only an authenticated
page carries.

```sql
create table session_touch_outcome (
  id          uuid primary key default uuidv7(),
  tick_id     uuid not null references session_touch (id),  -- the tick answered, never the key
  employer_id uuid not null references employer (id),
  renewed     boolean not null,                              -- not redirected to the door
  checked_at  timestamptz not null,
  unique (tick_id, employer_id)
);
```

One row per tenant per tick, naming the tick it answers; the upsert targets
that pair (`?on_conflict=tick_id,employer_id`). A shared key would make one
upsert address the same row twice. `renewed = false` is the interesting row: the
session lapsed and the next operation needs a fresh challenge. Nothing retries
a touch — the next tick is five minutes away and recomputes the same answer.

The outcome must be **a different table from the emits table, and one outside
the change feed's publication**. That is not stylistic: the emits table is a
change-feed source, and a pipeline that wrote its answer back into a table it
reads would feed itself the answer it just wrote.

### Reading a restricted table from the pipeline

The keep-alive needs each tenant's session cookies, and those cannot sit in a
table a browser can read. **This needs nothing from mecha.** The pipeline reads
PostgREST directly at `CRUD_URL` — never the gateway — carrying `SERVICE_JWT`,
and that token resolves to the `service` role, which holds `BYPASSRLS`. A table
whose policies admit neither `anon` nor `app_user` is therefore readable by the
pipeline and by nothing a browser can reach.

A restricted table settles the query path and only the query path. **A row's
contents reach the bus whatever its policy says**: every table in the change
feed's publication is read by logical replication, and logical decoding answers
to no RLS. So a credential in a column is a credential in Redis and in every
consumer group on `cdc-events`, whether that column sits on the emits table or
on the restricted table beside it. The emits table only makes it worse, by
putting it there on every tick rather than on every write.

The way out is not a policy. Keep the credential out of Postgres: store it
wherever the app already keeps blobs and let the row carry its key, since a key
on the bus is not a credential. Where it genuinely must be a column, leaving its
table out of the change feed's publication keeps it off the bus, and if the sync
service serves that table it is then on the browser's sync path instead — a
trade, not an answer.

## The wake

A row INSERT reaches PostgREST and never the bus, so the sweep knocks on the
door of the unit that reads the WAL — and the wake is an HTTP request, not a
publish. Above container tier daprd, conduit and transform are three containers
of one Cloud Run instance at `minInstanceCount: 0`, and only daprd holds the
ingress, so a request to daprd is what starts the other two.

Publishing to `/v1.0/publish/…/cdc-events` would do the opposite of what it
looks like: it puts a message on the bus and wakes neither puller, and every
CDC pipeline opens by dropping a message whose `.data` is not a non-empty
string, so it would be discarded on arrival too.

The endpoint is `GET /v1.0/healthz/outbound`, dapr's own readiness, which
answers 204 and is enough to wake the unit. On daprd 1.16.1 it answers once
daprd's servers are up, before daprd waits on its app channel. `/v1.0/healthz`
answers 500 until daprd's initialization completes, and that initialization
blocks until the app channel accepts a connection, so a wake that asked it
would fail for as long as daprd waits on an app that is not listening.

It fires only when the sweep emitted something, and no watermark moves until it
lands: a wake that fails leaves every schedule owing the same ticks, so the
retry rewrites the same keys and knocks again rather than stranding a durable
row nothing will read. On a unit pinned to `cpuIdle: false` a wake nobody needs
is a billed cold start.

Below cloud tier nothing scales to zero, so the wake delivers nothing: conduit
is already tailing the WAL and a tick reaches its pipeline whether or not
anything knocked. It is still required, and a failed one still holds every
watermark. That is the point. A wake aimed at the wrong sidecar is invisible to
the tests, invisible to the data — the rows travel regardless — and would
surface first in production, where it is the only thing keeping the pipeline
alive. Requiring it everywhere turns that into a DNS error on a laptop.

Because those containers rise together, a tick drains whatever the CDC path had
backed up, not merely the row it just wrote. An app with a schedule keeps its
own pipeline alive; an app with none has nothing waking that path at all.

## Clocks

One shape at every tier: a contentless `POST /poke` from something outside the
unit. What varies is only who sends it and how coarse it is. Never an
`rpk generate` input inside transform: a clock inside a unit at zero instances
cannot start it, and a schedule placed there is dead in the cloud and silent
about it.

| Tier | Clock | Resolution | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| docker compose | a `clock` service: rpk `generate` → POST | 60s (`POKE_INTERVAL`) | wired |
| k8s | one cluster-wide CronJob | 60s | not written |
| host (process-compose) | the same container | 60s | not written |
| cloud | Cloud Scheduler | 60s | not written |
| browser (wasm) | `setInterval` | ms | needs a different shell |

The binding floor is 60s, from Cloud Scheduler and CronJob. Local and compose
may be told to go finer, which is the dangerous direction: a schedule that
keeps pace on a laptop and never does in the cloud.

At k8s, deliberately **one** CronJob rather than one per schedule: the moment
k8s objects hold schedules, the missed and overlap policies are k8s's at that
tier and mecha's everywhere else.

### The cloud clock, as a contract

Not written, because it cannot be exercised before the ticker has a URL. What
follows is the whole of it, so a deployment can carry it without deciding
anything.

Declared beside the app's other Cloud Run resources as one `CloudSchedulerJob`,
cluster-wide rather than one per schedule. The moment scheduler objects hold
schedules, the missed and overlap policies belong to Cloud Scheduler at that
tier and to mecha everywhere else, which is the one-behaviour-per-tier split
this design exists to prevent.

```yaml
schedule:  "* * * * *"          # the floor; resolution, never cadence
timeZone:  "Etc/UTC"            # the tick's zone is the schedule row's, not this
httpTarget:
  uri:         "https://<app>-<hash>-<region>.run.app/poke?caller=cloud-scheduler"
  httpMethod:  POST
  body:        ""               # contentless: what is due is never the caller's
  oidcToken:                    # NOT the bearer, see below
    serviceAccountEmail: "<app>-clock@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    audience:            "https://<app>-<hash>-<region>.run.app"
retryConfig:
  retryCount: 0                 # a lost poke costs resolution; the next recomputes
```

Three things it fixes rather than copies from the compose clock.

**`?caller=cloud-scheduler`.** Recorded on every tick this job mints. It is the
only way to tell which clock is winning during a tier migration rather than
infer it, and running two is safe by construction.

**Auth is OIDC, not the bearer.** The compose clock sends
`Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_JWT` because everything inside the cluster
network already carries that credential. A Cloud Run URL is internet-facing,
and a permanently valid service token on a public path is a worse trade than
two auth mechanisms. So: Cloud Scheduler signs an OIDC token for its own
service account, the ticker's Cloud Run service is `--no-allow-unauthenticated`
with that account granted `roles/run.invoker`, and Cloud Run verifies the token
before the request reaches the container. **The ticker's own `SERVICE_JWT`
check then has nothing to verify** — it must either accept an
already-authenticated request at cloud tier, or the job must carry both, which
is the choice to make when this lands.

**`retryCount: 0`.** Cloud Scheduler's default retry would queue pokes behind
an unreachable ticker for no gain: due-ness is recomputed from the expression,
so the next minute's poke produces the same answer as the retry would.

The job must exist wherever the app runs in the cloud with a schedule that is
not suspended.

## Why a tick needs no durability

Due-ness is a pure function of `(schedule, now, done)`, so losing a tick costs
nothing: the next poke recomputes the same answer. The clock can be stupid, two
clocks can run at once without coordinating, a coarse clock produces exact
instants, and the only durable thing is the row the app already wanted.

The facts the design rests on:

- **PostgREST 12.2.3.** A conditional PATCH with
  `or=(last_tick_at.is.null,last_tick_at.lt.X)` is a no-op when the stored value
  is newer. A `tick_at` written as `…Z` reads back as `…+00:00`, which is why
  `tickId` normalises through `Date` before hashing.
- **Cloud Run.** In a two-container service at `minScale 0`, one request to the
  container holding the ingress starts the portless sibling a second later: it
  starts because the instance starts.
- **Postgres grants.** `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` in `002_grants` reaches every
  later table, mecha's own included: without a policy, `app_user` could repoint
  `schedule.emits_entity` and set `suspended`, which the ticker then acts on as
  `service`. `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` with no policy closes it.
- **croner.** `n/step` means n to the end of the field (`5/10` in minutes is 5,
  15 … 55); a parser reading a bare value as `lo = hi = n` matches only n, and
  the DST gap check then discards the rest silently.
- **A coarse clock.** Poking every 10 seconds against a minutely schedule
  produces exactly one tick per minute, on the minute. At cloud tier each poke is
  a billed wake, which is why `?caller=` is recorded.

**Edge and level.** An edge is an occurrence at a named instant: it can be
missed, must not double-fire, and wants identity, a watermark and a lateness
rule. That is a tick. A level is a predicate to re-assert, *make this false,
repeatedly*; running it twice is free, and it wants a guard at the point of use,
not a clock. A lease reaper, a stale-claim sweep — a conditional PATCH guarded on
unheld-or-expired makes the next claimer the reclaim — and a purge of old rows
are levels; a session keep-alive is an edge, which is what
`max_lateness_seconds` expresses. Reach for a tick only when lateness changes
the answer: most periodic work is a level wearing a cron expression.

Rejected:

- **dapr Jobs** deliver to the app's own endpoint, so the app must already be
  awake.
- **A durable tick stream** persists something reconstructible.
- **Fan-out inside the ticker** needs a resumable cursor and an all-or-nothing
  bulk insert; a tick is the app's row, with mecha's five columns written last.
- **A `schedule_run` table with a `historyLimit`**: retention is a level the app
  declares.
- **`done` as a filter over the emits table**: that table is a change-feed
  source and the publication is the loop breaker, so `done` names a different
  table.

## Not built

- **The cloud clock**, per the contract above. Until it exists the ticker fires
  nowhere that scales to zero.
- **An integration test** against a live cluster: a schedule seeded, a poke
  posted, one row emitted, a second poke producing nothing. Nothing exercises
  the ticker end to end.
- **The k8s and host clocks**, when a tier needs one. Both run the same
  container as compose; only `?caller=` differs.
- **The browser tier.** `due.ts` ports unchanged; `main.ts` does not — no Deno,
  no daprd to wake, and crud is
  [the wasm PostgREST subset](../../docs/browser.md#what-stands-in-for-what). That subset answers
  `resolution=ignore-duplicates` with a bare `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so the
  derived key holds there too.
- **A poke-specific credential.** `/poke` is routed on every app's public
  gateway and guarded only by `SERVICE_JWT` compared byte-for-byte, the token
  the ticker then writes with as `service`, which holds `BYPASSRLS`: the secret
  that must reach Cloud Scheduler on a public request is cross-tenant write
  access. A credential of its own costs one env var and makes a leak survivable.
- **`Forbid` when a tick row is pruned.** `priorFinished` reads an absent prior
  row as finished, right for a late tick and wrong for a deleted one, and a tick
  table is an app table an app may trim.
- Known and unfixed: `TICKS_PER_SWEEP` bounds one schedule rather than the pass,
  and a pass killed part-way commits no watermarks; a DST-skipped instant stalls
  the late-branch drain; a schedule producing only late ticks never wakes its
  reader; nothing checks that an emits table carries the five columns; a tick on
  the lateness horizon is neither run nor recorded.

## Open

- Cloud Scheduler → wake → drain, measured end to end. Stand transform up at
  `minInstanceCount: 0`, confirm a `generate` pipeline does not run, then measure
  a POST waking it and the stream draining once.
- Five-field cron cannot say "last business day", which some deadlines may
  eventually want. That is the moment to reach for RFC 5545 RRULE, and the
  ceiling is worth knowing before it is hit.
