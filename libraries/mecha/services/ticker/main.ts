// (schedule, now, done) — due.ts — so a lost poke costs nothing, a coarse
// poke costs only resolution, and two clocks poking at once cost nothing
// either. What this file adds is the shell: reading the schedules, writing
// through crud, and the ordering that lets a pass die anywhere and converge on
// the next poke.
//
// A tick IS the app's row — one write, not a demand plus a private ledger
// beside it. Answering it belongs to a CDC pipeline reading that row, and the
// answer lands somewhere else again, because a source cannot be its own sink.
// The one thing this file does past writing the row is knock on the door of
// the unit that reads the WAL: at cloud tier that unit is asleep, and a row
// nobody reads is not a tick.
