-- The tenancy floor: the row-level isolation every mecha database has, whatever

--
-- Permissive policies OR together; restrictive policies AND with everything; a
-- table with RLS enabled and no permissive policy denies all. So a restrictive
-- policy is a floor nothing above it can widen, and the design rests on that:
-- a bug in the generated rules layer is an outage, never a breach.
--
-- The policy text lives here and nowhere else. A generator emits
-- `CALL rls_protect('<table>')`, never the policy itself, so it cannot emit a
-- subtly wrong one and a correction reaches every app by migration.

-- The one thing that grants breadth, so its failure modes are the ones that
-- matter: it fails closed on an unset GUC, and drops empty elements rather than
-- minting a '' scope that would match everything. Assertions 6 and 19 say why.
-- STABLE so Postgres evaluates it once per statement and not once per row.

--
-- The other sanctioned reach across scopes is the emitted validation trigger,

-- AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE. AFTER, so only a write the caller's own policies
-- already admitted reaches the definer's read: a caller who cannot write the
-- row cannot use the predicate as an oracle over rows they cannot see. It reads
-- the rows an entity's declared `via` edges name -- one query per edge, joined
-- on the referenced id -- and answers once per write. The refusal it raises
-- carries only `validation <table>.<name>`, never a row, so the reach discloses
-- one bit per admitted write and nothing else. Its precondition: the migration
-- role must bypass RLS, as a superuser or a role holding BYPASSRLS. Where it
-- does not, FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY scopes the definer's read by the CALLER's
-- app.scopes and the trigger judges what the writer can see rather than what
-- stands -- so the emitted validation migration opens with a DO block that
